## Inspiration 

### Snakeybus

as in it will be a [snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) game in the streets of the city. As player builds up the crowd for the carnival, the people joining in will create a long tail behind the player. The player will be forced to find alternative routes thought the town's streets and infrastructure in order to navigate to the locations they need.

### Rio Carnival

See [Rio carnival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Carnival)
