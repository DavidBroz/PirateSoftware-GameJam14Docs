## Player Experience

Player will navigate on top down map ordering units of firefighters to fight the fire, evacuate citizens and cut down the trees in order stop the wild fire. Player will be tested for his **planning and resource managment skills** as they will have to deal with difficult terrain and logistics.
## Goal
Get the wild fire under control. 
## Genre
RTS, simulation
# Concept 

## Theme Interpretation
The **wildfire is spreading rapidly**.  The *it* in It's Spreading is the fire.  
## Primary Mechanics
### Terrain map
Terrain map show the space where is the fire. The map contains rivers, lakes, towns, roads, trees, hills, and grasslands. That interact with the fire 
![[concept_terrain_map.png]]
### Fire
Fire is the main threat in the game and it spreads to surrounding objects that can catch on fire. Depending on conditions like if the object is wet or dry, how hard it is to set on fire (grass easy, tree harder), how far it is from the fire source, and what is the wind direction. 
### Firefighter trucks
Player can select and control firefighting units to move around the map and what to do. They can fight the fire directly, cut trees down, wet objects, and even start their own fire. 

Firefighting trucks can navigate fast around roads but are very slow outside them. Every firetruck also has an amount of water they hold that needs to be replenished near a river, lake or city once depleted. 
## Other mechanic

### Fire fuel
Each objet has a number that tells for how long it can burn.
### Planes 
Firefighters can use planes to wet or put out fire in remote, hard to reach positions. They need to refuel before very action (cooldown) and have.
### Firefighters burning
If the fire fighters get trapped in the fire, they will burn and player will lose the unit and some score. 
### Score
After the fire dies down, player gets a scored based on how many objects did not burn. Houses give a lot of points, trees less, grasslands a little. 
# Win condition
Put out the fire.
# Lose condition
Lose all houses to the fire.
