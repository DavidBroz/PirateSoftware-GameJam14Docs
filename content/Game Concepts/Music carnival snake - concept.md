## Game pitch

## Goal of the game

You are trying to make the whole town to join the carnival. 
## Inspiration 

### Snakeybus

Game takes some inspiration from the videogame [Snakeybus](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1012560/Snakeybus/)
as in it will be a [snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) game in the streets of the city. As player builds up the crowd for the carnival, the people joining in will create a long tail behind the player. The player will be forced to find alternative routes thought the town's streets and infrastructure in order to navigate to the locations they need.

### Rio Carnival

See [Rio carnival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Carnival)

## Player Experience

Player will play through levels each consisting of streets and buildings of a town. **Each level will be it's own town** with it's own unique challenges. Player will need **navigate** thought the level and visiting certain location in certain order and **plan the route** in a way that doesn't cause the to collide with the tail of the carnival.     

## Genre
Snake, puzzle, casual

# Concept 

## Theme Interpretation

There is a spontaneous **carnival mood spreading** through the city with each street one by one joining in as the player visits them. 


## Primary Mechanics

## Other mechanic
### Subway
Works like teleporter.
### Overwalk
It's a bridge that allows the player to walk over the the carnival tail
### Bus
 When player enters the bus, his whole carnival tail will do the same (everyone fits in like a clown in a clown car). Bus waits until everyone is on board. Bus then moves to different location and starts depositing all the passengers. Works like a teleporter that condenses the carnival tail for a period of time. 
### Musician buildings
Some buildings will provide you with additional musicians with their own instrument that will join the carnival tail (like bass or guitar).
### Picky listeners
Some buildings will require you to have certain musical instruments in your carnival tail in order to join in on the carnival. 

# Win condition
You manage to collect all the buildings.
# Lose condition
You collide with the carnival tail.
