## Game pitch 

You are playing as a musician playing his trumpet in a small town, compelling every citizen you walk by to join you in a spontaneous carnival and follows you thorough the streets. 

## Goal of the game

You are trying to make the whole town to join the carnival. 
## Inspiration 

### Snakeybus

Game takes some inspiration from the videogame [Snakeybus](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1012560/Snakeybus/)
as in it will be a [snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) game in the streets of the city. As player builds up the crowd for the carnival, the people joining in will create a long tail behind the player. The player will be forced to find alternative routes thought the town's streets and infrastructure in order to navigate to the locations they need.

### Rio Carnival

See [Rio carnival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Carnival)

## Player Experience
